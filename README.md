# appcenter-publish-plugin


# Setup : Add the plugin to your project 

# Configuration
Build script snippet for plugins DSL for Gradle 2.1 and later:
```kotlin

plugins {
  id "com.ins.gradle.plugin.android.appcenter-publish-plugin" version "1.1"
}
```
Build script snippet for use in older Gradle versions or where dynamic configuration is required:
```kotlin
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.com.ins.gradle.plugin.android:appcenter-publish-plugin:1.1"
  }
}

apply plugin: "com.ins.gradle.plugin.android.appcenter-publish-plugin"


```



And the configuration block following the template :
```kotlin

appCenter {

    defaultConfig {
        apiToken = "default-api-token"               // Required. Token generated on your AppCenter account
        appOwner = "your-own-name"                  // Required. User or Organization name who owns the App on AppCenter
        destination = "user-group-name"             // Required. Name of the Test Group on AppCenter
        releaseNotes = "your-release-notes"        // Optional. Release notes...
        verbose = "false"                         // optional. Default is false
        appNameSuffix = "your-app-name-suffix"      // Optional 
    }
    productFlavors {
        flavor1 {
            appName = "flavor1-name"           // Custom name for flavor 1 app (optional)
            destination = "flavor1-user-group-name"     // Custom name for flavor 1 group of users (optional)
            releaseNotes = "flavor1-release-notes" // Optional. Release notes for flavor1
            verbose = true
        }

        flavor2 {
            appName = "flavor2-name"           // Custom name for flavor 2 app (optional)
            releaseNotes = "flavor2-release-notes" // Optional. Release notes for flavor2
             verbose = true
        }
        
        prod {
            appNameSuffix = "-Prod"
        }
        
         dev {
            appNameSuffix = "-Dev"
        }


    }

}
```

the app Variant configuration will be a merge of custom configuration and default.
For instance, for flavor2 configuration will be

```
        apiToken = "default-api-token"               
        appOwner = "your-own-name"                  
        destination = "user-group-name"             
        releaseNotes = "your-release-notes"       
        verbose = "true"                     
        appName = "flavor2-name"    
        releaseNotes = "flavor2-release-notes" 

```


This plugin is also compatible with multi-dimensions

for instance you can define in android DSL : 

```kotlin
 flavorDimensions "dimensionA", "dimensionB", "dimensionC"

    productFlavors {

        company        {  dimension 'dimensionA' }

        flavor1 {
            dimension 'dimensionB'
            ...
          
        }
        flavor2 {
            dimension 'dimensionB'
            ....
        }

        prod  { dimension 'dimensionC' 
                ...
        }
        dev { dimension 'dimensionC'
                ...
        }

    }

```

in this situation, variant app "companyFlavor2DevRelease" configuration will be a merge of each flavors with respect of dimension order in the list: 

```
        apiToken = "default-api-token"               
        appOwner = "your-own-name"                  
        destination = "user-group-name"             
        releaseNotes = "your-release-notes"       
        verbose = "true"                     
        appName = "flavor2-name"    
        releaseNotes = "flavor2-release-notes" 
        appNameSuffix = "-Dev"

```

# Usage

The appcenter-publish-plugin will add tasks for each variant following the pattern : 

```
  upload${variantName}AppCenter
```

for instance in our last example you will be able to call the task this way: 

```
  ./gradlew app:uploadCompanyFlavor2DevReleaseAppCenter
```

# Nota Bene

Be aware that the appcenter-publish-plugin is aware in split configuration in the way that, if used, only the "universal" apk assembled will be uploaded

# For future version

Will be nice to avoid creation of tasks in the case of unsigned version, they are not allowed in the AppCenter
